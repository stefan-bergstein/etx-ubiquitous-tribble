      When to choose core-pair subscriptions. You will most often choose core-pair subscriptions when you
      are deploying self-managed OpenShift to public cloud hyperscalers, within an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
      (IaaS) private cloud, or when you are deploying on a hypervisor such as VMware vSphere, Red Hat OpenStackÂ® Platform, or Nutanix.
      Core-pair subscriptions remove the need to attach subscriptions to physical servers and allow the freedom for pods to be deployed
      across your hybrid cloud whenever and wherever needed. You can also use core-pair subscriptions on bare-metal
      servers or devices (i.e., with no hypervisor). Be aware there is usually a compute pod density where bare metal
      socket-pair subscriptions may be more cost effective.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          When should I choose OpenShift core-pair subscriptions?
        answer: |
          You should choose core-pair subscriptions when deploying self-managed OpenShift on
          public cloud hyperscalers, within an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) private cloud, or on a
          hypervisor such as VMware vSphere, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, or Nutanix.
      - question: |
          What advantage do core-pair subscriptions offer for hybrid cloud deployments?
        answer: |
          Core-pair subscriptions remove the need to attach subscriptions to physical servers,
          giving you the freedom to deploy pods across your hybrid cloud whenever and wherever needed.
      - question: |
          Are there cases where socket-pair subscriptions might be more cost effective than core-pair subscriptions?
        answer: |
          Yes, when running OpenShift on bare-metal servers, if the compute pod density is high enough,
          bare-metal socket-pair subscriptions could be more cost effective than core-pair subscriptions.
document_outline: |
  This guide from Red Hat outlines the subscription models for self-managed Red Hat OpenShift environments,
  providing definitions for key terms like core-pair and bare metal socket-pair subscriptions, which are the
  two primary types. It details the different Red Hat OpenShift editions available, such as Kubernetes Engine
  and Container Platform, explaining what to count for subscriptions, with specific instructions for various
  hardware configurations including bare metal and virtualized environments. The document also addresses special
  use cases like disaster recovery and migrations, clarifies what does not require subscriptions, and offers a
  step-by-step approach with examples to estimate the number of subscriptions needed based on application
  instances and hardware resources.
